<h4>Motivation</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

 Authors of accepted <a href="https://asplos-conference.org">ASPLOS'20</a> papers 
 are invited to formally submit their supporting materials (code, data, models, workflows, results) 
 to the <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/submission.html">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>.

 AE is run by a separate committee whose task is to <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">assess</a>
 how submitted artifacts support the work described in accepted papers while reproducing at least some experiments. 
 <b>This submission is voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.</b>

 <br><br>
 Since it is not always trivial to perform a full validation of computer architecture experiments
 and may require expensive computational resources, we use multistage Artifact Evaluation:
 we will validate only the "availability" and "functionality/reusability" of submitted
 artifacts at ASPLOS'20.
 Thus, depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the Artifact Appendix 
 and will receive at most two ACM stamps of approval printed on the first page (note that authors 
 still need to provide a small sample dataset to test the functionality of their artifacts):

  </center>

 <br>
 We think that the second AE stage can be a special reproducibility session or an open tournament
 to perform a full validation of experimental results from above papers 
 with artifacts at the next conference based on the successful 
 <a href="https://cKnowledge.org/request.html">ASPLOS-ReQuEST'19 experience</a>.
 It is under discussion so feel free to provide your feedback
 to the ASPLOS AE chairs!

<h4>Public discussion</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
 We plan to organize an open session at ASPLOS to discuss artifact evaluation results and a common methodology to perform a full validation and comparison of computer architecture experiments 
 (see related SIGARCH blogs <a href="https://www.sigarch.org/a-checklist-manifesto-for-empirical-evaluation-a-preemptive-strike-against-a-replication-crisis-in-computer-science">"A Checklist Manifesto for Empirical Evaluation: A Preemptive Strike Against a Replication Crisis in Computer Science"</a> 
 and <a href="https://www.sigarch.org/artifact-evaluation-for-reproducible-quantitative-research">"Artifact Evaluation for Reproducible Quantitative Research"</a>).

<h4>Artifact submission</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
 Prepare your submission and this <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae-20190108.tex">Artifact Appendix</a> 
 using the following <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/submission.html">guidelines</a> and register it at the 
 <a href="https://asplos20ae.hotcrp.com">ASPLOS'20 AE website</a>. 
 Your submission will be then reviewed according to the <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">following guidelines</a>.
 <b>Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies 
 in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!</b>

 <br><br>
 The papers that successfully go through AE will receive a set of ACM badges of approval printed on the papers themselves 
 and available as meta information in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM Digital Library</a> 
 (it is now possible to search for papers with specific badges in ACM DL). 
 Authors of such papers will have an option to include Artifact Appendix to the camera-ready paper (up to 2 pages)
 and <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/digital-artifacts">share their artifacts in the ACM DL</a>.

 <br><br>
 At the end of the process we will inform you about how to add badges 
 to your camera-ready paper.
