<h4>Process</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

It is becoming increasingly difficult to reproduce and compare results from computer architecture papers 
<sup><a href="https://www.sigarch.org/artifact-evaluation-for-reproducible-quantitative-research/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.sigarch.org/a-checklist-manifesto-for-empirical-evaluation-a-preemptive-strike-against-a-replication-crisis-in-computer-science">2</a></sup>.

ASPLOS'20 features a reproducibility initiative to encourage code and data sharing 
to help the community validate and compare alternative approaches in computer architecture.
It is based on the Artifact Evaluation process (AE) 
successfully introduced at <a href="https://artifact-eval.org">programming language</a>
and <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae">systems/ML</a> conferences.

<br><br>
Authors of accepted ASPLOS'20 papers are invited to formally 
describe supporting material (code, data, models, workflows, results) 
using the <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/templates/ae-20190108.tex">standard Artifact Appendix template</a>
and submit it to the <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/submission.html">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>.
Note that this submission is <b>voluntary and will not influence</b> the final decision regarding the papers.

<br><br>
Since it may be very time consuming to perform full validation of computer architecture experiments
while requiring expensive computational resources, we decided to only validate if submitted artifacts 
are "available" and "functional" at ASPLOS'20. However, authors still need to provide 
a small sample dataset to test the functionality of submitted artifacts.</b>

Thus, depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the Artifact Appendix 
and will receive at most two ACM stamps of approval printed on the first page:

<h4>Submission</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
You need to prepare your artifacts and appendix using the following 
<a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/submission.html">guidelines</a>.
You can then submit your paper with artifact appendix via 
dedicated <a href="https://asplos20ae.hotcrp.com">website</a> before December 2, 2019.
Your submission will be then reviewed according to the 
following <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">guidelines</a>.
Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies 
in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!

<br><br>
AE is run by a separate committee whose task is to <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">assess</a> 
how submitted artifacts support the work described in accepted papers
based on the standard <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy</a>.

<br><br>
Since it may be very time consuming to perform full validation of AI/ML experiments
while requiring expensive computational resources, we decided to only validate if submitted artifacts 
are "available" and "functional" at SysML'19. However, you still need to provide 
a small sample data set to test the functionality of your artifact.</b>

Thus, depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the artifact appendix and will receive at most two ACM stamps of approval printed on their first page:
 <p>
 <center>
  <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/reviewing.html#artifacts_available"><img src="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/gallery/acm/publications/replication-badges/artifacts_available_dl.jpg" width="90"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 </center>

At the end of the process we will inform you about how to add badges 
to your camera-ready paper.
