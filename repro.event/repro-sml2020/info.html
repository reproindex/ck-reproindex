<h4>Process</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

 <p>Following the successful introduction of the artifact evaluation process 
 at <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/sysml2019.html">MLSys'19</a>
 and the success of the related initiatives at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf">NeurIPS'19</a>
 and <a href="https://asplos-conference.org/calls/#artifacts">ASPLOS'20</a> (more than half of the accepted papers submitted artifacts for evaluation),
 we will continue the reproducibility initiative at the
 Conference on Machine Learning and Systems 2020.

 <p>
 The Conference on Machine Learning and Systems promotes reproducibility 
 of experimental results and encourages code and data sharing 
 to help the community quickly validate and compare alternative approaches. 
 Authors of accepted papers are invited to formally describe supporting materials 
 (code, data, models, workflows, results) using the 
 <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/templates/ae-20190108.tex">standard Artifact Appendix template</a>
 and submit it to the <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/submission.html">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>. 

 <p>
 Note that this submission is <b>voluntary and will not influence</b> the final decision regarding the papers.
 The point is to help authors validate experimental results from their accepted papers by an independent AE Committee 
 in a collaborative way, and to help readers find articles with available, functional, and validated artifacts!

<h4>Artifact submission</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

<p>You need to prepare your artifacts and appendix using the following 
<a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/submission.html">guidelines</a>.
You can then submit your paper with the artifact appendix via 
the <a href="https://systemsandml20ae.hotcrp.com">dedicated AE website</a> before January 15, 2020.
Your submission will be reviewed according to the 
following <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">guidelines</a>.
Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies 
in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!

<p>AE is run by a separate committee whose task is to <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">assess</a> 
how submitted artifacts support the work described in accepted papers
based on the standard <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy</a>.

Depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the artifact appendix and a set of ACM stamps of approval printed on their first page:

    <td><a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging#reproduced">results reproduced</a></td>
   </tr>
-->
  </table>

<br>
<p>At the end of the process we will inform you about how to add badges 
to your camera-ready paper.
