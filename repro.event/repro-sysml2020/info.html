<h4>Process</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

 <p>Following the successful introduction of the artifact evaluation process 
 at <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/sysml2019.html">SysML'19</a>
 we will continue the reproducibility initiative at SysML'20.

 <p>
 SysML promotes reproducibility of experimental results and encourages code and data sharing 
 to help the community quickly validate and compare alternative approaches. 
 Authors of accepted SysML'20 papers are invited to formally describe supporting materials 
 (code, data, models, workflows, results) using the 
 <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/templates/ae-20190108.tex">standard Artifact Appendix template</a>
 and submit it to the <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/submission.html">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>. 

 <p>
 Note that this submission is <b>voluntary and will not influence</b> the final decision regarding the papers.
 The point is to help authors validate experimental results from their accepted papers by an independent AE Committee 
 in a collaborative way, and to help readers find articles with available, functional, and validated artifacts!
 For example, ACM Digital Library already allows one to find papers with available artifacts and reproducible results!

<h4>Artifact submission</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

<p>You need to prepare your artifacts and appendix using the following 
<a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/submission.html">guidelines</a>.
You can then submit your paper with artifact appendix via 
dedicated SML2020 AE website before January 10, 2020.
Your submission will be then reviewed according to the 
following <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">guidelines</a>.
Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies 
in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!

<p>AE is run by a separate committee whose task is to <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">assess</a> 
how submitted artifacts support the work described in accepted papers
based on the standard <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy</a>.

Depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the artifact appendix and a set of ACM stamps of approval printed on their first page:

 </center>

<p>At the end of the process we will inform you about how to add badges 
to your camera-ready paper.

<h4>Public discussion</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
 We plan to organize a public discussion about how to improve the reproducibility of experimental results and reusability of research components at SML2020 - please stay tuned for more details.
